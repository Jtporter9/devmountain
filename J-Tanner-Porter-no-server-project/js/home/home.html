			<h2>Welcome to my Portfolio website.</h2>
			<hr>
			<p> I am a pursuing Junior Web Developer, and this is a site to display information about myself, and my continually growing
				developmental skill sets. </p>
			<p> I never saw myself as a developer, until I was. What I mean by that is that by the time I wrote my first line of code, and
			saw what the page rendered I fell in love. I entered in the full time immersive Web-development course and DevMountain in Provo, Utah
		  in early october of 2015. I have been writing code everyday since then.  </p>
			<p>
				I have had good opportunities to build projects at DevMountain and outside of it. This webpage will help display some of the skills I
				have learned along with some of the projects I have built. Some myself, and others in groups, being able to collaborate together.
				I know that team work and collaboration are vital to this field of work, and I look forward to the opportunity of working with others,
				helping eachother and learning form eachother.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thoughout the site you will be able to see some of my skill sets, to start I would at this point in my life pride myself in becoming a Full Stack, but feel
				comfortable with both frontend, and backend development. developer. I enjoy very much being able to build views with sytle and functionallity. I firstly
				 started out learning the simple, and the beginning to web-dev this being HTML and CSS. From there I was able to learn more, starting with JavaScript,
			 for functionallity. Then came Angular, Firebase, Node,
				MongoDB, Express, Mongoose, LESS CSS, socket.io, and other growing technologies like ES6 Javascript and ReactJS.

			</p>
			<p>
				 There is a mix of Frontend and Backend technologies here, in which I feel comfortable, I feel most comfortable as a MEAN stack developer,(
				 it being the one I have used the most.
				 ) but feel comfortable as well with react. Especially as I have started to use if more and more in my projects. In the Portfolio page there are
				 a few expamles of sites I have built there are descriptions, and links to the sites themselves. I love Coding, and am excited to expand my knowledge
				 though the years to come. Enjoy the website.
